## Personal Growth
Im extremely happy with the way this turned out. This project made me better with both React and Java Script, and also CSS, Flex Box, and using API Data. I even got to try and play around with Animations.

## Things To Work On
I attempted to increase the search parameters but could not figure it out. I also wanted to play around with animations more instead of only using the things I know how to do. I will continue expanding my knowledge and make my next project even better!
